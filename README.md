# Angular with Dexies JS 

Dexie.js is a wrapper library for indexedDB - the standard database in the browser. http://dexie.org

Dexie solves three main issues with the native IndexedDB API:

        - Ambivalent error handling
        - Poor queries
        - Code complexity

Dexie provides a neat database API with a well thought-through API design, robust error handling, extendability, change tracking awareness and extended KeyRange support (case insensitive search, set matches and OR operations).
